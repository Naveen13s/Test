//Delete Kth Element of DLL
/*Given the head of a doubly linked list and an integer k, remove the node at the kth position of the linked list and return the head of the modified list.

Examples:
Input: head -> 2 <-> 5 <-> 7 <-> 9, k = 2
Output: head -> 2 <-> 7 <-> 9
Explanation: The node with value 5 was removed.

Input: head -> 2 <-> 5 <-> 7, k = 1
Output: head -> 5 <-> 7
Explanation: The node with value 2 was removed, note that the head was modified.

Input: head -> 2 <-> 5 <-> 7, k = 3
Output: head -> 2 <-> 5
Constraints:
n == Number of nodes in the linked list
1 <= n <= 100
0 <= ListNode.val <= 100
1 <= k <= n   */
