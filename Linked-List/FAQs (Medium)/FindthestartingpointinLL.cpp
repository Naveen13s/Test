//Find the starting point in LL
/* 
Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to find the starting point of a loop in the linked list if it exists. Return the starting node if a loop exists; otherwise, return null.
A loop exists in a linked list if some node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos denotes the index (0-based) of the node from where the loop starts.
Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Examples:
Input: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, pos = 1
Output(value of the returned node is displayed): 2
Explaï»¿nation: The tail of the linked list connects to the node at 1st index.

Input: head -> 1 -> 3 -> 7 -> 4, pos = -1
Output(value of the returned node is displayed): null
Explanation: No loop is present in the linked list.

Input: head -> 6 -> 3 -> 7, pos = 0
Output: 6
Constraints:
0 <= number of nodes in the cycle <= 105
0 <= ListNode.val <= 104
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked list
