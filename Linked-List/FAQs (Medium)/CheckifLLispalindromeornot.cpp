//Check if LL is palindrome or not
/*
Given the head of a singly linked list representing a positive integer number. Each node of the linked list represents a digit of the number, with the 1st node containing the leftmost digit of the number and so on. Check whether the linked list values form a palindrome or not. Return true if it forms a palindrome, otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backwards.
Examples:
Input: head -> 3 -> 7 -> 5 -> 7 -> 3
Output: true
Explanation: 37573 is a palindrome.

Input: head -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1
Output: false
Explanation: 1121 is not a palindrome.

Input: head -> 9 -> 9 -> 9 -> 9
Output: true
Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes in the Linked List <= 105
0 <= ListNode.val <= 9
The number represented does not contain any leading zeroes.
