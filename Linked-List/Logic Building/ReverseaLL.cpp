//Reverse a LL
/*Given the head of a singly linked list. Reverse the given linked list and return the head of the modified list.

Examples:
Input: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Output: head -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
Explanation: All the links are reversed and the head now points to the last node of the original list.

Input: head -> 6 -> 8
Output: head -> 8 -> 6
Explanation: All the links are reversed and the head now points to the last node of the original list.
This can be seen like: 6 <- 8 <- head.

Input: head -> 1
Output: head -> 1
Constraints:
0 <= number of nodes in the Linked List <= 105
0 <= ListNode.val <= 104   */
