//Check if the Array is Sorted I
/*Given an array arr of size n, the task is to check if the given array is sorted in (ascending / Increasing / Non-decreasing) order. If the array is sorted then return True, else return False.

Examples:
Input: n = 5, arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: True
Explanation: The given array is sorted i.e Every element in the array is smaller than or equals to its next values, So the answer is True.

Input: n = 5, arr = [5,4,6,7,8]
Output: False
Explanation: The given array is Not sorted i.e Every element in the array is not smaller than or equal to its next values, So the answer is False. Here element 5 is not smaller than or equal to its future elements.

Input: n = 5, arr = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: False
Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 106
- 109 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
