/*Given a sorted array of integers nums with 0-based indexing, find the index of a specified target integer. If the target is found in the array, return its index. If the target is not found, return -1.
Examples:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: The target integer 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: The target integer 2 does not exist in nums so return -1

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = -1
Output: 0
Constraints:
  1 <= nums.length <= 105
  -105 < nums[i], target < 105
  nums is sorted in ascending order.  */
