//Search in rotated sorted array-I
/*Given an integer array nums, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point that is unknown. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.

Examples:
Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 0
Output: 4
Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.

Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 5
Output: 1
Constraints:
  1 <= nums.length <= 104
  -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
  All values of nums are unique.
  nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
  -104 <= k <= 104   */
